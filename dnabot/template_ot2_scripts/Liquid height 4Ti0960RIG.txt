Total well depth ~15 mm
Internal well diameter 5mm; radius = 2.5
Offset from centre approximately 1 mm for each 5mm well depth - it is a smooth transition
top -5 mm should have an x offset of 2 mm to touch side (radius )
    diameter = 4 mm; radius = 2 mm; 2/2.5 = 0.8; 80% of diameter
top - 10 mm should have an x offset of 1 mm to touch side
    diameter = 3 mm; radius = 1.5 mm; 1.5/2.5 = 0.6; 60% of diameter
Over a 3h period at room temperature liquid loss due to evaporation is approximately 1-2 ul.
